[Click here for API docs][1]

## Quick Start

Since panorama is still in active development, install from git master with

```
cargo install panorama --git https://github.com/iptq/panorama
```

Then, create a config file. The format along with examples can be found in
[this page of the manual][2].

That's it! Run `panorama` forever.
